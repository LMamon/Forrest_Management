# Markov Decision Process (MDP) with MDPToolBox

This project explores Markov Decision Processes (MDP) through Python, utilizing the [MDPToolBox](https://pymdptoolbox.readthedocs.io/) package. It serves as an educational resource to understand and implement decision-making models in stochastic environments.

## Features
- **MDPToolBox Integration**: Practical usage of Python's MDPToolBox to solve MDP problems.
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Introduction to Markov Decision Processes.
  - Hands-on examples of policy iteration and value iteration.
  - Visualization of MDP solutions.
- **Applications**: Learn how MDPs apply to real-world problems like resource allocation, robotics, and AI.
